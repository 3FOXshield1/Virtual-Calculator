# Virtual-Calculator Using OpenCV
This project is a virtual calculator built using OpenCV, a computer vision library, in Python. It detects hand gestures for selecting numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations.

## Features  <br/>
 >> Virtual calculator interface displayed on-screen.<br/>
 >> Calculation performed when index and middle fingers are close together over a button.<br/>

 ## Requirements 
1. Python 3.x <br/>
2. OpenCV library (opencv-python) <br/>
3. NumPy library (numpy) <br/>

## Usage  <br/>
 1. Run the main.py script
 2. A window will appear showing the virtual calculator interface.<br/>
 3. Place your hand in front of the camera, making sure it's well-lit and there's enough contrast between your hand and the background.<br/>
 4. Perform hand gestures for selecting numbers, operations<br/>
      1. To input numbers 0-9, show the corresponding number of fingers.
      2. To perform arithmetic operations, extend your thumb and index finger apart over the corresponding operation button.
 5. The result will be displayed on the virtual calculator interface.
